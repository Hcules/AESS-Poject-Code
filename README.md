AESS Project

It is an IOT based project using M2M Protocol.
Here I have made a system that can be used in an corporate or any other working environment. 

An RFID tag is used to get the login information of the worke and when the worker's attendance is marked sucessfully his/her respective workstation will be automatically turned on ( light, fan etc) 
the actuators are as adjusted as per the temperature reading from the temperature sensor.
